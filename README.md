## Workflows

### User Authentication

2. User is redirected to login page (provided by AVC-Bridge-Service)
3. User successfully get logged in by providing the same credentials as in the APEX app
4. AVC-Bridge-Service will generate & save an access token
5. AVC-Bridge-Service will return that access token to the Amazon Alexa companion app

All future requests with the Alexa Skill will include the access token generated by the login procedure
